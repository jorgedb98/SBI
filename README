For PP we expect the researchers to provide the pdb file as pdb containing 2 chains from the protein


For Nuc-Peptide we expect the researchers to provide the pdb file as: chain1=peptide chain2+chain3 DNA or chain2=RNA
  1. compare DNAs and align
  if alignment over 95%, superimpose and make it new ref structure
